NEXT STEP DIRECTIONS:

1. Fill out the fields in Step 3. There should be 3 fields:
     - Wireless network name: the name that appears on your computer
         or mobile phone when scans for connectable networks.
     - Wireless network password: the password for the wireless network name
         field. If the wireless network does not have a password, leave this
         field blank.
     - Google cloud print account: the Google account that you wish to use to
         cloud print documents on the currently-connected printer.

2. Once the fields have been filled out, click on "Submit" at the bottom of
     the page. After clicking on "Submit", another page will be printed within
     a few minutes. Depending on whether the device has been able to connect
     to your wireless network, there would be either a check or cross on the
     page.

3. Follow the instructions on the second printed page.
